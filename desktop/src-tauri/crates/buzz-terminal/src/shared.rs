//! The lock the reader and the renderer contend for, and the meter on it.
//!
//! This lives in the engine crate rather than in the embedder because the
//! property it exists to prove is a property of the emulator *and* the lock
//! together: F1 bounds how many bytes one `feed` releases into the parser,
//! which bounds how long the reader can hold this mutex, which bounds how long
//! the renderer waits for it. Split the lock out to the Tauri layer and the
//! gate can only be written where no fixture runs.
//!
//! Measured, not assumed. Under a 180 MB/s flood the reader's own hold is
//! p50 1 us while the renderer's *acquire* is p50 4245 us -- four orders apart,
//! because 0.389% of calls carry 96.4% of the lock time. Holding time is the
//! wrong quantity; waiting time is the one a human feels. So the two planes are
//! metered separately: pooling them would let the reader's millions of fast
//! acquires dilute the renderer's tail into a false pass.
