//! Boot config sync: gather each coordinate's observable state, decide, enforce.
//!
//! This is the layer between the pure decision table
//! ([`super::decision::decide`]) and the stores it reads. It owns two things
//! the table deliberately does not: WHERE each input comes from, and the
//! ordering guarantees around reading them.
//!
//! # Ordering (V3.4)
//!
//! No network I/O may happen while the store lock is held, and no decision may
//! be made from inputs gathered under a different workspace:
//!
//! 1. capture `(relay, owner, db path)` as a scope snapshot;
//! 2. run the relay lookups with NO lock held;
//! 3. take `managed_agents_store_lock` for the whole decision pass;
//! 4. re-resolve the active scope and abandon the pass if it moved;
//! 5. evaluate the table and write, still under that one guard.
//!
//! Step 4 is load-bearing rather than defensive: `apply_workspace` can swap the
//! relay and keys mid-flight and does not take this lock, so without the
//! recheck a completed pull from community A could patch community B's shared
//! disk store.
