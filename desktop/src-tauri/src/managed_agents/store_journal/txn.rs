//! Closure-only mutation API (v34.1) and boot recovery driver.
//!
//! `mutate_store` is the **only** write entry point for the managed-agents
//! store.  It owns the full lock sequence:
//!
//!   in-process mutex (caller-held `store_mutex_guard`)
//!   → anchored OS advisory lock (acquired here)
//!   → fresh fail-closed decode
//!   → SQLite `BEGIN` transaction (journal mutations + file_commit_phase record)
//!   → stage both JSON files (fsync before rename)
//!   → SQLite `COMMIT` the transaction
//!   → rename managed-agents.json.stage (record 'first_renamed' phase)
//!   → rename teams.json.stage (record 'committed' phase)
//!   → release OS advisory lock
//!
//! A closure returning `Err` rolls back the SQLite transaction — no journal
//! row is written, no file is staged.  A crash after `COMMIT` but before the
//! final rename is recovered at next boot via `run_boot_recovery_at`, which
//! inspects the `file_commit_phases` row and re-executes the pending renames.
//!
//! Network I/O and keyring access stay outside every critical section —
//! they are driven by durable operation phases recorded in the journal.

/// Prepare and record immutable publication evidence in a single atomic step.

/// This is the **single publication authority** for B1.  It establishes
/// durable evidence in a recoverable ordered protocol across two databases:
///
/// 1. Inserts the outbox row (immutable event payload) into the journal
///    SQLite connection — `?`-propagated so a collision or journal failure
///    aborts before anything is flushable.
/// 2. Inserts the retention row with `pending_sync = true` into the retention
///    SQLite connection — `?`-propagated.
///
/// These two writes span two separate SQLite connections (journal and
/// retention) and therefore cannot be wrapped in a single SQL transaction.
/// The ordering is intentional: if the process crashes after (1) but before
/// (2), boot recovery reads the outbox row and re-inserts the retention
/// projection via `ensure_retention_row_for_payload`.  If (2) fails after
/// (1) succeeds, the same recovery path applies on next boot.
///
/// `IdentityCollision` from `insert_outbox_event` is converted to `Err` —
/// never silently discarded.
///
/// Callers that do NOT need a new outbox row (e.g. no content change) call
/// `retain_agent_record` directly and skip this function.
